QaTa-COV19-v1: The researchers of Qatar University and Tampere University have compiled QaTa-COV19 dataset, 
which consists of 4603 COVID-19 chest X-rays; for the first time, the dataset includes the ground-truth segmentation 
masks for COVID-19 infected region segmentation task. Together with the control group chest X-rays, QaTa-COV19 
consists of 120,968 images. The images can be found under QaTa-COV19/Images/ folder, and the ground-truth segmentation 
masks under QaTa-COV19/Ground-truths/. From 4603 images, 2951 of them have their corresponding ground-truth segmentation 
masks, which can be found as mask_FILENAME.png. 

QaTa-COV19-v2: The researchers of Qatar University and Tampere University have extended QaTa-COV19 dataset, 
which consists of 9258 COVID-19 chest X-rays including the ground-truth segmentation masks for COVID-19 infected 
region segmentation task. The images have their corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks, which can be found 
as mask_FILENAME.png. 

Early-QaTa-COV19: This dataset is a subset of QaTa-COV19 dataset, which consists of 1065 chest X-rays including 
no or limited sign of COVID-19 pneumonia cases for early COVID-19 detection. 

Control_Group: The chest X-rays that are in the control group can be found under Control_Group/ folder. 
There are two control groups in this folder. Control Group-I  consists  of  only  normal  (healthy)  
chest X-rays with 12,544 images. On the other hand, Control Group-II consists of 116,365 chest X-rays 
from normal and 14 different thoracic disease images. In Control Group II, the CHESTXRAY-14 folder 
includes train and test sets of ChestXray-14 dataset. In addition to this, bacterial and viral pneumonia 
from pediatric patients can be found in this folder. However, for the pediatric patient data, there are 
no train and test sets predefined.
